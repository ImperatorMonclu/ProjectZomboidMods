description=Would you like the zombies in Project Zomboid to adapt to the weather and the day-night cycle? Would you like the zeds to be faster, stronger or stealthier depending on the climate conditions? Or would you prefer their properties to be random and surprising? Then this mod is for you.
description=
description=With this mod, you can configure how the weather and time of day affect the zombies. You can choose whether the zombies will be slower or more aggressive when it rains, snows or fogs. You can also decide whether the zombies will be weaker or tougher when there is a full moon, crescent moon or new moon. And of course, you can determine whether zombies will be easier or harder to spot during the day or night.
description=
description=In addition, this mod allows you to make the zombies' properties procedural, i.e. they vary according to a random algorithm. This way you can have a more dynamic and unpredictable gameplay experience, where you never know how the zombies will react to the weather and the day-night cycle.
