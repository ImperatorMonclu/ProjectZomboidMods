title=Real Time Sleep
description=This mod makes the sleep time based on real-time, not the game time, to make multiplayer games more fun. Many players disable the tiredness option because they find waiting for everyone to sleep boring, but with this mod, they can enjoy a more dynamic and balanced game.

description=The default value of the multiplier will allow you to rest the maximum fatigue for approximately 10 minutes. So if you need to reduce the time you can increase the multiplier, e.g. if the multiplier is set to 2 your rest will be 5 minutes.
